When I was a child, I lived in an old house at the end of a quiet street. It was not very large, but it carried many good memories. The walls were cracked, the windows were small, and the garden was wild, yet it always felt warm and safe.

One day, my father brought home a new book. It was the first book that truly caught my attention. I remember opening it with curiosity and reading carefully from the first page to the last. The story was surprisingly long, filled with adventures, challenges, and lessons. I did not understand everything at that time, but I could already feel that it was something great.

That book also taught me the power of even a little detail. A single word, a single sentence, could change the meaning of an entire story. Inspired by this idea, I began to imagine my own stories. At first, they were short and simple, but little by little, they grew into something larger. I wanted to share them not only with myself but also with other people who might find joy in reading them.

Now, whenever I think of that old house and the new book that changed my childhood, I realize how small beginnings can shape a lifetime.
