There are moments in life when a single person changes everything. I remember a day many years ago when I met an old man by the river. He was sitting quietly, holding a book in his hand, watching the water flow.

At first, I thought he was just a stranger, but the way he spoke to me was different. He told me, “The most important thing in this world is not how much you own, but how much you can give.” His words stayed in my heart.

Over time, I began to understand what he meant. The world is wide, and life is short. If we only chase after wealth or fame, we may miss the true meaning of our journey. But if we use our hands to help others, to build something kind and lasting, then even one person can leave behind a light that shines for many years.

That day taught me that sometimes the smallest thing—a conversation, a gesture, a word—can guide us on a better way through life.
